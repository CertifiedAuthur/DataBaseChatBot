# Database Q&A Chatbot

This project is a **Database Q&A Chatbot** built using **Streamlit**, **Langchain**, and **OpenAI**. It allows users to ask questions related to a database, and the chatbot provides answers based on the database's content.

## Features

- **Database Interaction**: The chatbot connects to an SQLite3 database and retrieves information based on user queries.
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Uses Langchain's few-shot learning to provide relevant examples for better question answering.
- **API Integration**: Connects to the OpenAI API for natural language processing, enabling users to ask complex questions.
- **Customizable**: Users can upload their own OpenAI API key for personalized usage.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `streamlit`
- `langchain`
- `openai`
- `huggingface`
- `chromadb`
- `sqlite3`
- `pydantic`
- `toml` (for reading configuration files)

You can install the necessary libraries with:

```bash
pip install streamlit langchain openai huggingface chromadb pydantic toml
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname.git
   cd repositoryname
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Upload Your API Key**:
   - Open the app and paste your **OpenAI API key** into the text area provided.

## How to Run

To start the chatbot, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will open the application in your browser. You can then input your questions, and the chatbot will return answers based on the database content.

## File Descriptions

- **`main.py`**: The main Streamlit application file that handles the user interface and interacts with the chatbot backend.
- **`langchain_helper.py`**: Contains the logic for interacting with Langchain, setting up the database chain, and querying the OpenAI model.
- **`database1.db`**: The SQLite3 database used for the Q&A process.
- **`few_shots.py`**: Defines the few-shot examples used for better context and training of the language model.

## How It Works

1. **User Interface**: The user enters a question in the Streamlit app.
2. **API Key**: The app uses the OpenAI API key provided by the user.
3. **Query Execution**: The question is processed by Langchain's SQL database chain to query the SQLite3 database.
4. **Answer Generation**: The chatbot generates a relevant answer using the OpenAI API based on the database content and few-shot examples.

### Customization:
- You can replace `repositoryname` and other placeholders in the README with your actual repository details.
- The project can be expanded to include other types of databases or NLP models if needed.

Let me know if you need additional adjustments!
